# One Shell of a Place!

## 💡 Inspiration 💡

Public opinion matters when it comes to advocating for causes like marine life. Animals like rhinos and orangutans get the attention they need to prevent their extinction through funding, but what about other animals without this kind of exposure? We had this thought process in mind when we created ‘One Shell of a Place’ - a gamified application that brings attention to the marine animals without the same measure of popularity.

## ⚙ What it does ⚙

It’s a gamified application where the user, as a diver, bumps into marine animals and is asked to input their thoughts about that animal. We then used Cohere and Supervised Learning in Scikit-learn's Support Vector Machine (SVM) to classify and perform sentiment analysis on the user's input. The responses are labeled under the hood as ‘positive’, ‘neutral', or 'negative' and are backed up in Microsoft Cloud’s database. The data is used to advocate for the well-being of the marine animals that are usually not in the media’s spotlight and are in need of funds to help their species survive. We hope this application will bring awareness and shed light on the unnoticed creatures under the sea.

## 🏗 How we built it 🏗

This is our first time dealing with any kind of machine learning and Cohere and Scikit-learn was definitely something that we spent a considerable amount of time understanding. We had to go back to the fundamentals in order to do sentiment analysis with supervised learning successfully.

## Accomplishments we’re proud of

-   We’re proud that we were able to able to utilize supervised machine learning and sentiment analysis even though we’ve never delved into that before.
-   We’re proud we were able to create a gamified experience for a cause that we were deeply passionate about.
-   We’re proud that we were able to continue working together and establish decent communication throughout our team despite multiple delays, internet issues, and bugs.

## What we learned

We learned how to create a machine learning model that did sentiment analysis on a phrase or word intelligently and how to create a concept of a gamified experience for a cause.

## What's next for One Shell of a Place

We want to create a better user experience by improving the UI and adding more responsiveness. We also want to add more ‘game’ levels as well as fine-tune the machine learning models in order to do sentiment analysis on multiple languages and more complex sentences.
